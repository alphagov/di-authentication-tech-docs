# Before you integrate with GOV.UK One Login

Before you begin your integration with GOV.UK One Login, you should consider:

* how many services within your organisation you’re planning to integrate
* if your services need to share users, in case you’re integrating more than 1 service
* if you need to create a reusable component to standardise integration across your organisation, in case you’re integrating a large number of services
* what the scope of your individual services is and whether this meets the GOV.UK Service Standard definition of a service 

If you’re integrating multiple services, you should [create a configuration for each service you’re integrating](/before-integrating/#create-a-configuration-for-each-service-you-re-integrating). 

Make sure you scope your services according to the [GOV.UK Service Standard guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) on how users think and what they need to do. Find more [information on scoping your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service). 

## Create a configuration for each service you’re integrating

GOV.UK One Login is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. An OIDC ‘relying party’ is an app that outsources its user authentication function to an identity provider, which in this instance is GOV.UK One Login.

To interact with GOV.UK One Login, you must first [register each of your services with GOV.UK One Login as a relying party](/integrate-with-integration-environment/manage-your-service-s-configuration/#register-your-service-to-use-gov-uk-one-login). You need to do this for each of the services that you want to integrate with GOV.UK One Login.

Part of the service’s configuration is the `client-id`, which is a unique identifier that GOV.UK One Login uses to identify your services. Each service should have a distinct `client-id`.

GOV.UK One Login uses `client-id` for: 

* retrieving configurations
* event auditing
* performance analytics 
* fraud prevention and data sharing

When you are ready to set up your service’s configuration, follow the guidance on how to [manage your service’s configuration with GOV.UK One Login](/integrate-with-integration-environment/manage-your-service-s-configuration/#manage-your-service-s-configuration-with-gov-uk-one-login).

### Why you should use a specific configuration for each service

You must use individual configurations for each of your services to get the following benefits: 

* GOV.UK One Login can provide a report detailing each service’s performance including success rates and volumes
* if a service gets compromised, the outage is limited to an individual service
* fraud analysis can use information about how users access different services and better profile and detect fraudulent behaviour
* the support team has more context regarding user activity and can better support with user queries
* users have visibility on all available services and their activity logs which makes navigation to specific services easier and suspicious activities more likely to be detected  

If you are not using individual configurations for each of your services, be aware that:

* fraudulent activity cannot be easily profiled and detected
* you cannot get service specific analytics and we cannot generate these retrospectively in case you decide not to have individual configurations from the start
* your users cannot benefit from simplified navigation and service specific information through their user journey

Organisations with multiple services may have additional requirements such as:

* sharing users across services - to enable this, [set up a common sector identifier](/integrate-with-integration-environment/manage-your-service-s-configuration/#choose-your-sector-identifier-uri)
* users that want to switch between services - to support users switching between services, your service must call the `/authorize` endpoint each time a user requests access to a new service
