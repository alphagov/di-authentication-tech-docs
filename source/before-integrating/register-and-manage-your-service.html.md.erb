# Register and manage your service

You get a unique client ID when you register your service. You'll need this client ID to integrate each of your services with GOV.UK One Login. 

You should configure multiple client IDs if you have multiple environments, for example staging, user acceptance testing, integration, production. There's further [guidance on creating a configuration for each service you’re integrating](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/create-individual-configurations-for-each-service/#create-a-configuration-for-each-service-you-re-integrating).

Registering should take 5 minutes to complete. To register your service to use GOV.UK One Login, you'll need: 

* a government email address
* a mobile phone

If you do not have a government email address or mobile phone, you should find a civil servant in your team who can register the service on your behalf.

Whoever registers the service will have the entry tied to their email address. It is currently not possible to reassign ownership if someone leaves or to add multiple email addresses to a particular client. If you need access after someone has left, you can create an additional client using a different email address and transfer the configuration settings to the new account. 

1. Go to the [Get started with GOV.UK One Login](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/getting-started) page. 
1. Select **Register your interest** and follow the on-screen instructions – if a prompt appears, the username is `integration-user` and the password is `winter2021`. 
1. Fill in the details using this table.

## Request signing with the RS256 algorithm 

By default, GOV.UK One Login will sign the `id_token` JSON Web Token (JWT) using the `ES256` algorithm but some third party tooling does not support `ES256`. If your service needs an alternative algorithm, we can sign your `id_token` JWT using the `RS256` algorithm. Let us know if you need this when you register your service.


## Update your service’s details with GOV.UK One Login

You can [update your service's details](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/register) to amend things like scopes you're requesting.
