# Use the correct token authentication method

The platform you use to integrate with GOV.UK One Login will affect which token authentication method you need to use. 

Most services will use `private_key_jwt`. However,  if youâ€™re using a third-party platform which does not support `private_key_jwt`, you may be granted an exception to use `client_secret_post`.

You can [read more guidance on third-party platforms](/before-integrating/integrating-third-party-platform/) to learn about which ones do not support `private_key_jwt`.
