# Generate a key pair

You’ll need to provide a public key when registering your service.

You can generate a key pair (a public key and a corresponding private key) using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

You’ll need your private key when:

* you’re registering your service to use GOV.UK Sign in environments, such as sandbox or production
* you request the token using the private key authentication mechanism on the `/token` endpoint

<%= warning_text('Once you’ve generated your private key, you must store the key in a secure location, such as a file vault, and you must not share the private key.') %>

Run the following on your command line to generate your key pair:

```
Generate private_key.pem

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

Generate corresponding public_key.pem

openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

You have now generated your key pair, which will appear on your machine as 2 files:

* `public_key.pem` - this is your public key, which you should share with GOV.UK Sign in
* `private_key.pem` - this is your private key, which you should store securely and not share
