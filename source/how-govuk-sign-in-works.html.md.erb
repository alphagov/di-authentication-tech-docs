# How GOV.UK Sign In works
GOV.UK Sign In is an [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant service that helps you authenticate your users who are using their GOV.UK Account.

GOV.UK Sign In’s core functionality works in 3 steps.

1. Sending your users to GOV.UK Sign In to begin authentication.
1. Getting your user’s consent to share their data.
1. Generating tokens to get information about your users.

You can read [guidance about cookies on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/help/cookie-details) if you want to learn more about cookies for GOV.UK Accounts.

## Sending your users to GOV.UK Sign In to begin authentication

GOV.UK Sign In uses OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow to authenticate your users.

1. Your user selects the button on your service, which causes your service to call the `/authorize` endpoint to start the sign in process.
1. Your user is redirected to GOV.UK Sign In to begin the authentication process.
1. If your user is not already logged in, GOV.UK Sign In asks them to authenticate themselves.
1. Your user either creates a GOV.UK Account, or enters their credentials and submits them to GOV.UK Sign In.
1. GOV.UK Sign In validates the user’s credentials.

## Getting your user’s consent to share their data

If your user is using your service for the first time, GOV.UK Sign In will send a request to your user to ask if they agree to share their data.

<%= image_tag "getting-user-permission.svg", { :alt => '' } %>


1. GOV.UK Sign In shows your user a list of attributes your service has requested.
1. Your user can choose to accept or reject sharing the attributes with your service.
1. GOV.UK Sign In records the user’s choice to accept or reject.

You can read more about [choosing which user attributes your service can request](/choose-which-user-attributes-your-service-can-request/).

## Generating tokens to get information about your users

GOV.UK Sign In will generate:

* an ID token, which contains the unique subject identifier (UUID) for your user
* an access token, which your service can use to access additional attributes (if the user has given permission)

<%= image_tag "generating-tokens.svg", { :alt => '' } %>


1. After getting your user’s consent, GOV.UK Sign In redirects your user back to your service, along with an authorisation code tagged onto the end of the URL.
1. Your service calls the `/token` endpoint with the authorisation code to get an ID token and an access token.
1. GOV.UK Sign In returns an ID token and an access token to your service.
1. Optionally, your service can use the access token to make a call to the `/userinfo` endpoint to access additional attributes if the user has agreed to share these.
