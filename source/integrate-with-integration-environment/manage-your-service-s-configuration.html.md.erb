# Manage your service’s configuration with GOV.UK Sign In

GOV.UK Sign In is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

Before being able to interact with GOV.UK Sign In you must first register your service with GOV.UK Sign In as a ‘relying party’. You will have to do this once for the integration environment and once for the production environment. An OIDC relying party is an app that outsources its user authentication function to an identity provider, which in this instance is GOV.UK Sign In.

## Register your service to use GOV.UK Sign In

To register your service to use GOV.UK Sign In, you need to:

1. Understand GOV.UK Sign In’s user identifiers.
1. Contact the GOV.UK Sign In team and we will register your service for you.

### Understand GOV.UK Sign In’s user identifiers

GOV.UK Sign In supports 2 types of user identifier:

* pairwise - default choice for services integrating with GOV.UK Sign In
* public - limited to internal use in GDS

You will set the user identifier your service will use when you contact the GOV.UK Sign In team to register your service with GOV.UK Sign In.

When you use a pairwise identifier, GOV.UK Sign In provides a unique `sub` value in the ID token to each service. This prevents having the same user ID across services, so each user ID is unique and cannot be correlated.

When you use pairwise as your user identifier, you'll need to specify your `sector_identifier_uri` parameter when you contact the GOV.UK Sign In team to register your service. GOV.UK Sign In will use this to create a unique subject identifier for your user.

<%= warning_text('If you do not specify the <code>sector_identifier_uri</code>, GOV.UK Sign In will use the host name of your redirect URI when we generate the subject identifier for your user. You should be aware that if your redirect URI ever changes, your users’ subject identifiers will also change.') %>

### Contact the GOV.UK Sign In team to register your service

You'll need to contact the GOV.UK Sign In team to register your service.

1. Start an email and include the following details.
1.  [Send the email with the completed details to govuk-sign-in@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto: govuk-sign-in@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
1. The GOV.UK Sign In team will register your service for you and let you know when the registration is complete.

The GOV.UK Sign In team will need these details to register your service:

* your service’s name
* your service’s redirect callback
* your service’s contact email addresses - this can be a group email or multiple separate email addresses or a combination of both
* the scopes you selected when you [chose which user attributes your service can request](/integrate-with-integration-environment/choose-which-user-attributes-your-service-can-request/)
* the [key you generated][key pair] - only send the contents of the `public_key.pem` file and do not include the RSA headers (the words in caps above and below the key)
* the URL you’d like your users redirected to if they log out of your service - if you do not specify one, your users will be redirected to the default GOV.UK sign out page
* your `sector_identifier_uri` (if you chose pairwise as your user identifier above), with the identifier for your sector
* your service type, which will be the value `MANDATORY`
* whether your service would need identity verification


## Update your service’s details with GOV.UK Sign In

To update your service’s details with GOV.UK Sign In, you need to send an email to [govuk-sign-in@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto: govuk-sign-in@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). We will get back to you with the next steps.

## Progress your application to integrate with the integration environment

Once the GOV.UK Sign In team has registered your service, you are now a relying party for GOV.UK Sign In.

The next step before you can use the integration environment is to [integrate your application with Authorization Code Flow][code flow].
