# Manage your service’s configuration with GOV.UK Sign In

GOV.UK Sign In is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

You must first register your service with GOV.UK Sign In as a ‘relying party’ before being able to interact with GOV.UK Sign In. You need to do this once for the integration environment and once for the production environment. An OIDC relying party is an app that outsources its user authentication function to an identity provider, which in this instance is GOV.UK Sign In.

## Register your service to use GOV.UK Sign In

The process to register your service will be different depending on whether you're registering needing authentication only, or both authentication and identity. 

### Registering your service which needs authentication only

If your service needs authentication only, you can use the [admin portal](admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/email-address) to:

* register your service
* log and store all aspects of your registration, for example your service name, which user attributes you want to request, or your public key
* update your service's details 

### Registering your service which needs both authentication and identity

If you’re part of our identity private beta, contact the onboarding team you’ve been dealing with. 

If you’re not part of our identity private beta and you’re a central government service which needs identity checks, [join our mailing list](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/mailing-list) to be updated when they become available. In the meantime, you can test the authentication journey. 

## Choosing your `sector_identifier_uri` 

Your service will use a [pairwise user identifier](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#PairwiseAlg) when you use GOV.UK Sign In.

When using a pairwise identifier, GOV.UK Sign In provides a unique `sub` value in the ID token to each service. This means a user ID will not be the same across services, so the value cannot be matched and used to identify an individual user.

Sector identifiers are optional. If this field is left empty, the redirect URI's root path is automatically used as the sector identifier.

If you're needing authentication only, you can specify and store your `sector_identifier_uri` in the [admin portal](admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/sign-in
). 

<%= warning_text('If you do not specify the <code>sector_identifier_uri</code>, GOV.UK Sign In will use the host name of your redirect URI when we generate the subject identifier for your user. You should be aware that if your redirect URI ever changes, your users’ subject identifiers will also change.') %>

The next step is to [choose your level of authentication for your service](/integrate-with-integration-environment/choose-the-level-of-authentication/).
