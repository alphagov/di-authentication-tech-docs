# Test your integration with GOV.UK Sign In

Once youâ€™ve [integrated your service with Authorization Code Flow](/integrate-with-integration-environment/integrate-with-code-flow/), you can test your integration with GOV.UK Sign In.

To make sure your integration is working as you expect it to, you should create sample users to test:

* registering a new user
* logging in an existing user
* test you receive the expected scopes you selected when you [chose which user attributes your service can request](/integrate-with-integration-environment/choose-which-user-attributes-your-service-can-request/), for example email and phone number
* logging a user out

After you have tested your integration with GOV.UK Sign In, get back in touch with the GOV.UK Sign In team. They will support you with progressing your application and integrating with the production environment.
