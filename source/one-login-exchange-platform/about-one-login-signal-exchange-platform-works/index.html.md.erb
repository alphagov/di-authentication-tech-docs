# How the GOV.UK One Login Signals exchange platform 

When a user is redirected from your service to GOV.UK One Login, GOV.UK One Login will record the users activity during the users interaction with GOV.UK One Login. As the user interacts with GOV.UK One Login, certain activities will trigger different signals which may send programatically to your receiver.

The sending of events happens asynchronously and independant to the GOV.UK One Login authentication flow.
