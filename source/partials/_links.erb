As a result, GOV.UK One Login could not return the medium level of identity confidence (`P2`) and instead returned a lower level of identity confidence.<br><br> If you’re using return codes, you will not receive this error. Instead, GOV.UK One Login returns an array of single letter `returnCode` values through the `userinfo` endpoint. Find more information on [understanding the return codes claim](/integrate-with-integration-environment/prove-users-identity/#understand-your-user-s-return-code-claim).<br><br>The second scenario is that the session in the user’s browser is unavailable. This can happen when your user’s cookies have been lost or your user changed browsers during the identity verification process. In this scenario, you should ask your user to log in again or restart the identity verification process. |
