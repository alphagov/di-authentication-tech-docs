# How Shared Signals Exchange Platform (Outbound) works 

Shared Signals Outbound uses the [Shared Signals Events Framework](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html) (SSE) to send events related to user activity. Whenever there is user activity within GOV.UK One Login, that activity is then mapped into a [Security Event Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417) (SET) which GOV.UK One Login will then send to your receiver using a POST request.

When a user is redirected from your service to GOV.UK One Login, GOV.UK One Login will record the users activity and can send events to one or more receivers

The sending of events happens asynchronously and separate to the GOV.UK One Login authentication flow

## What kind of events can you receive

Events that are supported by GOV.UK One Login are

Specific to users interacting with GOV.UK One Login with your service

Events related to the user but not to an interaction with your service.

You cannot receive events about users interacting with GOV.UK One Login with different government services
