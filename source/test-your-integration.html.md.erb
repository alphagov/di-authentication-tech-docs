# Test your integration with GOV.UK Sign In

Once youâ€™ve [integrated your service with Authorization Code Flow](/integrate-with-code-flow/#integrate-with-authorization-code-flow), you can test your integration with GOV.UK Sign In.

To make sure your integration is working as you expect it to, you should create sample users to test:

* registering a new user
* logging in an existing user
* test you receive the expected [scopes you selected](/select-supported-scopes/#select-supported-scopes), for example email and phone number
* logging a user out

After you have tested your integration with GOV.UK Sign In, you can request access to the production environment.
