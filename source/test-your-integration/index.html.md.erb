# Test your integration with GOV.UK One Login

Once youâ€™ve [integrated your service with Authorization Code Flow][integrate.authenticate], you can test your integration with GOV.UK One Login.

To make sure your integration is working as you expect it to, you should create sample users to test:

* registering a new user
* logging in an existing user
* test you receive the expected scopes you selected when you [chose which user attributes your service can request][integrate.choose-user-attributes], for example email and phone number
* logging a user out

After you have completed these steps, you are ready to [configure your service for production][integrate.go-live].
